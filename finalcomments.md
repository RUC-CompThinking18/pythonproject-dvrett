# Comments
You had some good line-by-line comments, but you were missing the robust comments I was hoping to see at the beginning of classes or functions giving the big-picture "why" of each piece of your code.

# Code Quality
There's an admirable attempt at encapsulation here using the Question class to save yourself a bit of typing. However, the class was never correctly instantiated, which means that your class didn't necessarily do what you wanted it to do, even though you did well in thinking out the program flow.

Your code didn't run due to an indent error (and the class error would have prevented it if it weren't for that), so it's a little hard to comment on the experience of playing. However, it's clear that the scenarios were thoughtful and meaningful.

# Ambition
I think this is an admirably ambitious project. I would have liked to have seen a bit more in your README about the overall scope of the project that you weren't able to complete.
