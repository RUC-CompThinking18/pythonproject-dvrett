Definitely much more robust than what you had at the last code review, which is great. You've clearly put in some work on this since then. The code didn't run, which is what this check was, at least partially, about, so be sure to check your indentation carefully before you submit the final project. As you look toward the final submission, I recommend two things: one, try to look for ways to encapsulate this code a bit and save yourself some typing. Right now, each scenario is wrapped in its own function which looks similar to the other functions: how can you write a single function that will ask each question in turn? Two, and I know you're already looking at ways to do this, see how you can expand the scope of the project to include more scenarios.
