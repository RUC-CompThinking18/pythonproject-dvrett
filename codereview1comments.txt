I feel like I shouldn't even be commenting on this given the conversation we had yesterday, so consider this a formality rather than a real assessment of this work. The general advice I would give, having now looked at this, is that you should spend more time, right now, thinking of the *how* of your program rather than the what. That is, think about what you want it to do (ie define functions) rather than what it contains (ie define classes).
