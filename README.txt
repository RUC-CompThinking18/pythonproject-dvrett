This project is designed to impart empathy in the user by walking them through a
text-based choose-your-own-adventure-style sequence of scenarios that LGBTQ people
often face in real life. The first scenario is based on the experience an LGBTQ person
might have in trying to balance school while struggling with their identity,
discrimination, and other related factors. The second scenario is based on the experience
an LGBTQ person might have in trying to pick a career and find a job, based on how
accepting each field is and how sustainable it can be for them to live on. The third
scenario is based on the experience an LGBTQ person might have in trying to find housing
while having a same-sex partner or otherwise being visibly part of the LGBTQ community.
